# DS-Feynman

This is my attempt at a python library for drawing double-sided Feynman
diagrams commonly used in nonlinear spectroscopy literature. The idea is to be
able to generate a Feynman diagram and then generate a spectrum corresponding
to that diagram.

## Requirements

I'm developing the library in python 3, using the PyX library for the
rendering.
